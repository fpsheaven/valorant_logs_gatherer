# valorant_logs_gatherer
Gathers valorant logs for riot support automatically.

This app is made with python and gathers every log that is required from the [official riot page](https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048981973-Gathering-Logs-in-VALORANT).

I made this app for fun after i came back from the gym. Ignore my messy code, i have a condition.
